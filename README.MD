You are a nice farmer working on your field, but there's a swarm of wasps charging at you for no reason. 
But, fortunately, you have a laser gun at your hand. Now, defend yourself against those insects!

# How to run it
``` $ python3 little_wasps.py ```


# Use the arrow keys to navigate the laser pistol and space to shoot
-  ←: move left 
- →: move right 
- Space: Shoot 
- Q: quit 


# Troubleshooting:
IF Python cannot import tkinter correct, indicating 

    "If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk", 

Try using the following

 ```   $ brew install python-tk```
